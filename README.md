Contributing
============

Harp GUI is written using web technologies and distributed with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/docs/). To get up and running, ensure Node.js and npm are installed (and updated to the latest version), then install Electron with:

    npm install electron-prebuilt -g

then, while inside of this project folder, run:

    npm install

to install the project dependencies. Now just run `electron .` in this directory to start the app.

Debugging
---------

Like Chrome, you can use the keyboard shortcut shift+ctrl+i to bring up an inspector. You can use the javascript console to view errors and debug code. See the [Electron docs](http://electron.atom.io/docs/) for info about how Electron works.
